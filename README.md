# Super-Lizard

 An isometric adventure game based on the gameplay of Frogger, with a couple levels, a traditional limited life and retry system, as well as potential expansions upon the formula in the form of power ups or otherwise  
 
# Current Iteration

In its current form, Super Lizard is a fully functional Frogger base game with no roguelike functions yet. There is an existing main level that is repeated and points that are tracked for completion or for game overs. Cars currently effectively delete themselves while still producing more cars, this bug was fixed by making the clones a seperate game object which was deleted after a yielded time.
 
 # Documentation:
 
 Most of the code and work is located in the /assets folder of SuperLizard. Within the assets folder are a couple of scripts associated with in game sprites written in C# (ex. CarScript.cs, LizardScript.cs...). Inside the /assets you can find the Scenes folder which contains the levels that are gonna be implemented and you can also find the .png of the sprites used.
